# Database Dumps (Optional - keep generic dumps, ignore large specific ones if needed)

# Ignore specific large files if any, or binary data
*.bson
*.metadata.json
# Note: kept .json generally, but if metadata is large/generated, might ignore.
# Since the 'dump' folders seem to contain BSON files which are binary, it's often good to ignore them 
# found in backups, but maybe you want the initial seeds committed. 
# I will ignore *.bson in the root to be safe against committing large DB dumps accidentally, 
# unless they are meant for seeding. 
# Given the user has a specific 'db_dump' folder committed, I will allow that folder but ignore new temp dumps.
# actually, the user has 'db_dump' in the file list means it is committed. 
# I will NOT ignore 'db_dump' folder, but everything else looks good.
